Level 1 (Junior)

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

*In this section, describe your current background in quantitative finance. This could include:*
- *Relevant coursework or degrees*
- *Previous internships or jobs*
- *Personal projects or research*
- *Trading experience (if any)*
- *What sparked your interest in quant finance*

I don't have a large background in the finance world, but I am excited to begin learning more. I am a senior studying Data Science and working towards my masters in the field. My biggest experience in finance was interning with Goldman Sachs this past summer. I worked on the Syndicated Loans team doing business intelligence. I automated reports to help automate processes allowing other team members to tackle more client-related issues rather than busywork in their day-to-day. I have no trading experience. My interest in quant finance stems from my belief that the finance world has a great use for those with quantitative skills, and my data science skillset could be used well there, since many traditional finance students do not have the same background I do. 


## 2. Career Goals

*In this section, outline your short and long-term career goals. Be specific about:*
- *What roles or positions interest you*
- *Which companies or types of firms you'd like to work for*
- *Specific areas of finance you want to specialize in*
- *What you hope to achieve in 1, 5, and 10 years*

In the short term, I am interested in re-recruiting. I believe that I can strive for more than my current role gives me, both in terms of career trajectory and utilizing my skillset. I really enjoyed my time at Goldman, so I think that for now, I would like to remain there. I believe that the current job market and its trends show that I have a better chance at an internal transfer than a full re-recruit to another company, at least now. Long term, I hope to be working for a hedge fund or private equity group in some sort of quantitative role. While I am not sure this will be the case in 1 year, I could see myself leveraging the Goldman name and my contacts there to jump off somewhere else in the next 5-10.

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

*In this section, describe what specific knowledge, skills, or experiences you hope to gain from the Alpha Program:*
- *Technical skills (programming, math, statistics)*
- *Financial concepts and trading strategies*
- *Specific tools or platforms*
- *Networking opportunities*
- *How this program fits into your overall learning path*

I am most interested in growing my financial knowledge through this program. While I will definitely learn more about math and programming, I feel that as a senior, I need to "catch up" more on financial concepts and trading strategies, as I comparatively know nothing about those things. I am interested in networking opportunities, but I feel that those will be slightly different for me as opposed to freshmen/sophomores that have more time in their recruiting journeys, at least for immediately post-grad. I think that this program fits well into my learning path, as I can somewhat "start from scratch" alongside the younger members in terms of the financial aspects.

## 4. Current Technical Skills

*In this section, honestly assess your current technical skills. Rate yourself (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) in:*
- *Programming languages (Python, R, etc.)*
- *Data analysis tools*
- *Statistical analysis*
- *Financial modeling*
- *Machine learning*
- *Version control (Git)*
- *Other relevant skills*


I feel that I am fairly proficient in several coding languages. I would describe myself as advanced in R and SAS, while I am more intermediate in Python. I have never coded in C++. In terms of data and statistical analysis, I feel that I am fairly advanced. I am a beginner in terms of financial modeling. I have not used much Git, so I am fairly a beginner there. 


## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

*In this section, outline:*
- *Specific skills you plan to develop during this program*
- *How you will measure your progress*
- *Time commitment you're planning to dedicate each week*
- *Resources you'll use beyond the program materials*
- *Your definition of success for this program*

I am not sure how much C++ we will learn with this program, but that is something I am interested in learning more about. I really want to learn everything about finance, whether that is the basic models, what the Greeks are, all sorts of trading strategies and portfolio composition, or trading derivatives. I will measure my success by things such as comparing my knowledge to where I was before based on my test results at the first meeting, and how well I am able to explain the aspects of the Primer. I plan to put about 4 hours a week into this program, but will adjust that based on how I feel as we move along. I have a list of books on quant finance I plan to supplement my learning with. My definition of success in this program is building up and maintaining much more knowledge than I had previously, and being more confident in my ability to match up with others that might be interviewing for roles in the industry.
